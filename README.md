<h1 align="center"><B> MVC Backend Template</B></h1> 
A minimalist backend application is built with Node.js and Express, featuring a clean architecture with MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, including models, controllers, and routes. It provides a lightweight foundational structure for handling simple data operations. <br>

The application architecture is about users who can log their meals to the app. with 2 endpoints(objects): users and meals.

<h2><B>Key Components:</B></h2> 

- **Routes:** Establishes the API endpoints and connects them to the corresponding controllers.
- **Controllers:** Handles the business logic and orchestrates data flow.
- **Models:** Defines the data structure and interacts with the database.
- **Middlewares:** Implement additional functionalities in the request-response cycle. </B>
- **Server:** `server.js` - The entry point for starting the server.
- **Application Configuration:** `app.js` - Initializes and configures the Express application.
- **Package Configuration:** `package.json` - Describes your Node.js project, including dependencies and scripts.

<h2><B>Usage:</B></h2>
